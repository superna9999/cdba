= ABCD control tool
The ABCD control tool is used for remotely booting Amlogic TF-A images on development boards

= Dependencies
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libyaml-dev libftdi1-dev pkg-config meson for debian systems
dnf install systemd-devel libyaml-devel libftdi1-devel pkg-config meson for fedora systems

= Device side
On the host with the CDB Assist or Conmux attached the "abcd-server" executable is run
from sandbox/abcd/abcd-server. Available devices are read from $HOME/.abcd

= Build instructions

# meson . build
# ninja -C build

= Client side
The client is invoked as:

  abcd -b <board> -h <host> [-c <power-cylce-count>] u-boot.bin

<host> will be connected to using ssh and <board> will be selected for
operation. As the board's fastboot interface shows up the given boot.img will
be transfered and booted on the device.

The board will execute until the key sequence ^A q is invoked or the board
outputs a sequence of 20 ~ (tilde) chards in a row.

If the optional -c is given, the board will upon receiving the tilde sequence
restart the board the given number of times. Each time booting the given
boot.img.

== Device configuration
The list of attached devices is read from $HOME/.abcd and is YAML formatted.

=== Example
devices:
  - board: db2k
    abcd: 00000001
    name: "DragonBoard2k"
    fastboot: abcdef1
    voltage: 8000

  - board: mtp2k
    conmux: mtp2k
    fastboot: abcdef2
    fastboot_set_active: true

  - board: evb2k
    users:
      - username
    console: /dev/ttyUSB0
    fastboot: abcdef3
    fastboot_set_active: true

  - board: qrd8550
    alpaca: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-QUALCOMM_Inc._Embedded_Power_Measurement__EPM__device_6E02020620151F14-if01
    console: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-QUALCOMM_MTP_Debug_Board_MT77TGG2-if00-port0
